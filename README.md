# Logo-Constructo

 [![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A command-line application that constructs a simple SVG logo based on user input.

## Description

This is a command-line application that dynamically constructs a simple logo consisting of a shape (square, circle, triangle or diamond) and up to three characters. The font family, font size, text colour and shape colour can be selected by the user through a Node.js Inquirer command line interface. The completed SVG logo is saved in the './examples' directory with a user-entered file name.
