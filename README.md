# Logo-Constructo

 [![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A command-line application that constructs a simple SVG logo based on user input.

## Description

This is a command-line application that dynamically constructs a simple logo consisting of a shape (square, circle, triangle or diamond) and up to three characters. The font family, font size, text colour and shape colour can be selected by the user through a Node.js Inquirer command line interface. The completed SVG logo is saved in the './examples' directory with a user-entered file name.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Inquirer npm package
- SVG
- Classes
- Jest JavaScript Testing Framework npm package

The application is written in JavaScript and runs in Node.js. The Node.js Inquirer npm package is used to create the command line interface. The SVG logo is constructed using JavaScript classes. The Jest npm package is used for testing. The application is tested to ensure that the user input is validated and that the SVG logo is constructed correctly. User colour entries are validated using a regular expression to check for a valid hex colour code, or against a list of valid colour names loaded from a JSON file.
